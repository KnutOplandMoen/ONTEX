# AI-Augmented Clinical Trial Explorer (ACTE) for Osteosarcoma Now

## High-Level Details

### Repository Summary

This repository contains the source code for the AI-Augmented Clinical Trial Explorer (ACTE), a system designed for Osteosarcoma Now. The project's primary goal is to replace the current legacy clinical trial database infrastructure with a modern, AI-integrated system. This new system will automatically fetch global clinical trial data, use Generative AI to create patient-friendly summaries, and provide a human-in-the-loop interface for content validation before publication. The ultimate aim is to offer patients the most current and accessible clinical trial information, reduce manual workload, and eliminate reliance on third-party APIs.
